The JavaScript visualization code demonstrates the power of interactive data analysis through dynamic visualizations like bar and bubble charts. By integrating libraries such as D3.js and Plotly, it highlights how data can be transformed into visually engaging structures, making complex datasets easier to interpret. This approach is crucial for exploring patterns, relationships, and insights that could remain hidden in raw data. The code also emphasizes the importance of user interactivity, such as dropdown menus for filtering and selecting data, which enhances decision-making and analysis. Learning from this challenge, we can understand how to  dynamically update visualizations, and create dashboards that are both informative and user-friendly.

The solution code is found in the app.js file. All the other files are needed to run the app. 

For debugging, I primarily used the console to find errors. To help with code mistakes and to refresh my memory or learn along the way I used class notes and ChatGPT. The biggest challenge I had at some point was a missing parenthesis but I located it and the code finally worked.
